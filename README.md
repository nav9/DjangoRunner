# Django Runner
A program that slightly simplifies Django use, by providing a menu-driven interface. This project is under construction, but a few functionalities are already available.  
  
# To Run
python3 main.py  
  
# Project Files
The project is created with LiClipse (not Eclipse. This is LiClipse). However, it's not recommended to run the program from LiClipse, since some necessary environment variables that are necessary for Django, aren't available via the IDE. So it's recommended to run the program from the command prompt.
